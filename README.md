## About

A group project tasked to section teams by our Sub Teacher. This is my own version because why not coconut.

This Point-of-Sale system consists of:

- Sleek menu design with scroll & drag navigation
- Checkout bar/panel with realtime updates
- Features organized in a tab-style manner
- System administration / management tools

## Goals
- [x] Replicate as many features/looks as possible from existing/renowned point-of-sale software applications

- [x] Provide at least 7 products/items/menu

- [x] Provide clear and decent UI/UX

## Personal Touches

dahil over the top ako, kung ano ano nilalagay kahit di na alam pano nangyayari yun

- Used database (PostgeSQL) instead of text files for persistent storage
- Practised modularity
- VAT Rate (7%) for each product kasi tax is life
- Limit the menu display to 10 products and allow pagination when total products of specific menu category exceeds that
- Clear buttons for the checkout panel
- Virtual keypad input
- Hotkey (Alt + A) to navigate to administration tools
- Enabled searching through all categories or specific categories
